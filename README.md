# Notiary Public Issue Tracker

This is an issue tracker for the [Notiary](https://www.notiary.com) project. 
Here you can submit suggestions and bug reports, and the community can discuss them.

If you're new to GitHub: see the "Issues" tab above. Go there. If you have a 
suggestion or bug report, just hit "New Issue" and write a description. There
are labels that you can use to describe your issue. If you're going to submit 
an issue, please first look if anyone else has filed a similar issue; it's better
to consolidate issues and their discussions than to have many vaguely-related issues.

You can also see the progress on various issues, and what I am working on,
by going to the "Projects" tab. 

# Bug Report Guidance

If you encounter a bug that puts users' data or accounts at risk, please do
not make it public -- rather, confidentially email me at contact@johnloeber.com.
